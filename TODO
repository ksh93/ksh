TODO for AT&T ksh93, 93u+m bugfix branch

See the issue tracker:
https://github.com/ksh93/ksh/issues

______
Fix regression test failures:

- There are many regression test failures on NetBSD.

- There are some serious regression test failures on OpenBSD when ksh
  is compiled with AST vmalloc disabled, so the system standard malloc(3)
  is used. These probably represent real ksh93 bugs exposed by OpenBSD's
  security hardening mechanisms.

______
Fix currently known bugs affecting shell scripting. These are identified by
their modernish IDs. For exact details, see code/comments in:
https://github.com/modernish/modernish/tree/0.16/lib/modernish/cap/

- BUG_BRACQUOT: shell quoting within bracket patterns has no effect. This
  bug means the '-' retains it special meaning of 'character range', and an
  initial ! (and, on some shells, ^) retains the meaning of negation, even
  in quoted strings within bracket patterns, including quoted variables.

- BUG_IFSGLOBS: In glob pattern matching (as in case or parameter
  substitution with # and %), if IFS starts with ? or * and the "$*"
  parameter expansion inserts any IFS separator characters, those characters
  are erroneously interpreted as wildcards when quoted "$*" is used as the
  glob pattern.
