TODO for AT&T ksh93, 93u+m bugfix branch

______
Fix regression test failures:

- On OpenBSD, there are 15 locale-related test failures in variables.sh.
- There are many regression test failures on NetBSD.

______
Fix build system:

- ksh does not currently build on AIX or QNX.
- Reimport the removed nmake. It is necessary for changes in Makefiles
  to take effect. The machine-generated Mamfiles are now used as a fallback,
  but they are not meant to be edited by hand.

______
Fix currently known bugs affecting shell scripting. These are identified by
their modernish IDs. For exact details, see code/comments in:
https://github.com/modernish/modernish/tree/0.16/lib/modernish/cap/

- BUG_BRACQUOT: shell quoting within bracket patterns has no effect. This
  bug means the '-' retains it special meaning of 'character range', and an
  initial ! (and, on some shells, ^) retains the meaning of negation, even
  in quoted strings within bracket patterns, including quoted variables.

- BUG_CSUBSTDO: If standard output (file descriptor 1) is closed before
  entering a $(command substitution), and any other file descriptors are
  redirected within the command substitution, commands such as 'echo' will
  not work within the command substitution, acting as if standard output is
  still closed.

- BUG_IFSGLOBS: In glob pattern matching (as in case or parameter
  substitution with # and %), if IFS starts with ? or * and the "$*"
  parameter expansion inserts any IFS separator characters, those characters
  are erroneously interpreted as wildcards when quoted "$*" is used as the
  glob pattern.
